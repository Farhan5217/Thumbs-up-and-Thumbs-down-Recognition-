# Thumbs-up and Thumbs-down Hand Gesture Recognition

This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition system using OpenCV. The aim is to accurately recognize and classify thumbs-up and thumbs-down gestures. The system achieved an impressive 95% accuracy during user testing, involving over 30 participants.
## Description

Hand gesture recognition is a popular area of research in computer vision, with various applications in human-computer interaction and augmented reality. This project specifically targets the recognition of thumbs-up and thumbs-down gestures. By leveraging OpenCV, this system analyzes hand movements and shapes to classify the gestures accurately.

## Usage

1. Connect a webcam or a camera to your system.

2. Run the code.

3. Place your hand in front of the camera and perform thumbs-up or thumbs-down gestures.

4. The system will detect and classify the gestures in real-time, displaying the recognized gesture on the screen.
