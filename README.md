# Image Classification using CNN

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The implementation utilizes popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras to train and evaluate the model.

## Description

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks due to their ability to extract meaningful features from images.

The project uses a CNN architecture to learn and classify images of cats and dogs. It leverages transfer learning by utilizing a pre-trained model as the base model and fine-tuning it on the specific dataset.
## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a CNN model to classify images. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers with max pooling, followed by fully connected layers and a softmax output layer.
